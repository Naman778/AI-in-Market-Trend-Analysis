⚠️ **Important:**  
The LSTM model can be implemented **directly using `Final_Returns.csv`**.  
No additional preprocessing is required before model training, as all transformations
described above have already been applied.

## Methodology
- Prices transformed into daily log returns
- Multivariate time-series construction
- Rolling input sequences for LSTM
- Time-based train/test split to avoid look-ahead bias
- Model evaluation using RMSE and directional accuracy
